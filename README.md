# bob-plugins

Source-of-truth monorepo for Bryan's custom [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugins, used in the **Bob** vault.

These six plugins used to live only inside the vault under `~/bob/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/`, mixed in with third-party
community plugins and personal notes. This repo extracts the Bryan-authored plugins into one place so they can be
versioned, validated, and reviewed independently of the vault. The plugins are deployed back into the vault with
[`bob plugins sync`](#deploying-to-the-vault).

## Plugins

| Plugin                  | id                       | Version | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block ID Prompt         | `block-id-prompt`        |   1.1.1 | Prompt for custom block IDs and complete wiki block links to open tasks. |
| Bob Ledger Tools        | `bob-ledger-tools`       |   1.0.0 | Expand Bob daily-note snippets and ledger time ranges.                |
| Bob Navigation Hotkeys  | `bob-navigation-hotkeys` |   1.3.0 | Open parent/alternate notes and set bullet properties, including local task dependencies. |
| Bob Project Tasks       | `bob-project-tasks`      |   1.0.0 | Keep project task counts materialized in frontmatter.                 |
| Bob Vim Surround        | `bob-vim-surround`       |   1.4.0 | Add vim-surround `ys` motions, `cs` changes, `ds` deletes, and dot-repeat to Obsidian Vim mode. |
| Task Status Cycler      | `task-status-cycler`     |   1.0.0 | Cycle the active task line through configured Tasks statuses.         |

Versions are tracked **per plugin** — there is no lockstep release. Each plugin's authoritative version lives in its own
`plugins/<id>/manifest.json` (e.g. `bob-vim-surround` is ahead of the others at `1.4.0`).

## Layout

```text
bob-plugins/
  README.md
  LICENSE
  .gitignore
  package.json                  # repo tooling only (not a bundler)
  scripts/
    validate-manifests.mjs      # manifest + main.js sanity checks
  plugins/
    block-id-prompt/{manifest.json,main.js,styles.css}
    bob-ledger-tools/{manifest.json,main.js}
    bob-navigation-hotkeys/{manifest.json,main.js,styles.css}
    bob-project-tasks/{manifest.json,main.js}
    bob-vim-surround/{manifest.json,main.js}
    task-status-cycler/{manifest.json,main.js}
```

Each `plugins/<id>/` folder is exactly the shape Obsidian loads from `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/`.

## Development model

These are **plain CommonJS** Obsidian plugins. There is intentionally no TypeScript, no bundler, and no build step:
`main.js` is the source, not a generated artifact. Edit `main.js` directly.

Each plugin folder contains the files Obsidian reads when loading a plugin:

- **`manifest.json`** — plugin metadata. Obsidian loads a plugin from
  `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/manifest.json` + `main.js`, so the manifest `id` must match the folder name. Shape:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "bob-project-tasks",
    "name": "Bob Project Tasks",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "minAppVersion": "1.8.7",
    "description": "Keep project task counts materialized in frontmatter.",
    "author": "Bryan",
    "isDesktopOnly": false
  }
  ```

- **`main.js`** — the plugin code (CommonJS: `require(...)` / `module.exports`).
- **`styles.css`** — optional plugin CSS (currently `block-id-prompt` and `bob-navigation-hotkeys` ship one).

### Validation

```bash
npm run validate
```

`scripts/validate-manifests.mjs` checks every plugin under `plugins/`:

- `manifest.json` parses as JSON and has the required fields (`id`, `name`, `version`, `minAppVersion`, `description`,
  `author`);
- the manifest `id` matches its folder name;
- `version` is a valid `x.y.z` semver;
- `main.js` parses under Node (a syntax check via `node --check`; the code is never executed).

It exits non-zero if any plugin fails, so it is safe to run in CI or a pre-commit hook.

## Deploying to the vault

This repo is the source of truth; the vault's `.obsidian/plugins/<id>/` folders are deploy targets. Deploy with
[bob-cli](https://github.com/bbugyi200/bob-cli):

```bash
bob plugins list                 # show repo plugins + their vault install/sync state
bob plugins sync                 # copy all six plugins repo -> vault
bob plugins sync -p bob-project-tasks   # sync a single plugin
bob plugins sync --dry-run       # preview without writing
```

`bob plugins sync` copies only `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (when present). It never touches a plugin's
`data.json` or other runtime/settings files, and it refuses to overwrite vault plugin files that are dirty in the vault's
git repo unless `--force` is passed.

> During the migration the vault keeps its own working copies of these folders; `bob plugins sync` is the deploy path.
> Making this repo the *sole* source of truth (e.g. `git rm --cached` of the folders from the vault) is a deliberate
> later decision.

## Scope

This is a **private personal monorepo** for developing the Bob plugins, not a distribution channel. The Obsidian
community-plugin registry and BRAT both map one plugin id to one repository with one release stream, so a multi-plugin
monorepo is a poor fit for direct official publishing. If a plugin (e.g. `bob-vim-surround` or `block-id-prompt`) is ever
published, it should be split into its own public repo following the standard Obsidian layout (root `manifest.json`,
`README.md`, `LICENSE`, and releases tagged to match the manifest version).
